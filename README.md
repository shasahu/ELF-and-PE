# ELF-and-PE
ELF is short for Executable and Linkable Format. It’s a format used for storing binaries, libraries, and core dumps on disks in Linux and Unix-based systems.

Moreover, the ELF format is versatile. Its design allows it to be executed on various processor types. This is a significant reason why the format is common compared to other executable file formats.

PE stands for Portable Executable, it’s a file format for executables used in Windows operating systems, it’s based on the COFF file format (Common Object File Format).

Not only .exe files are PE files, dynamic link libraries (.dll), Kernel modules (.srv), Control panel applications (.cpl) and many others are also PE files.

A PE file is a data structure that holds information necessary for the OS loader to be able to load that executable into memory and execute it.
